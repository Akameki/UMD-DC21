# University of Maryland | Data Challenge 2021 | USDA Branded Foods Dataset

## About This Repository
This repository and the code within were made during the week of Febuary 20-27, 2021, as a part of the annual [University of Maryland Data Challenge](https://datachallenge.ischool.umd.edu/). We were tasked with analyzing the [USDA Branded Foods Dataset](). The files were forked over to a public repository after the challenge had ended. 

## Navigating the Repository
Project deliverables are found in the main repo folder, namely the [abstract](https://github.com/Akameki/UMD-DC21/blob/main/abstract.pdf)<sup>[✝](#abstract-footnote)</sup>, [presentation](https://github.com/Akameki/UMD-DC21/blob/main/presentation.pdf), and [one page summary](https://github.com/Akameki/UMD-DC21/blob/main/summary.pdf).  
Source Code can be found in the [`/src/`](https://github.com/akameki/umd-dc21tree/main/src) folder, with comments at the top of each code file, giving a basic overview of the file. 

## Notable Processes & Findings
We focused our study on three main components: the most common ingredients in each category, the average number of calories per serving in each category, and relations between ingredients within categories.
The most common ingredients were as follows: 
Ingredient | Appearances 
-----------|------------
Salt | 3808
Water | 3301
SUGAR | 2398
SPICES| 2148
CITRIC ACID| 2120
